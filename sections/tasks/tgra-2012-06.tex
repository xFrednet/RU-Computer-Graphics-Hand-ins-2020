\subsection{(10\%) Bezier motion (2012 No. 6)}
Scalars in bezier curves are found by factoring Bernstein polynomials:
\begin{itemize}
    \item BL = ((1 - t) + t) L for a bezier curve with L + 1 control points.
\end{itemize}

An object is moved along a bezier curve with 4 control points.
\begin{itemize}
    \item P1 = (15, 5, 2)
    \item P2 = (10, 2, 2)
    \item P3 = (5, 7, 2)
    \item P4 = (0, 0, 2)
\end{itemize}

The motion should start 4 seconds after the program starts and it should end 20 seconds later, 24 seconds after the program starts.

\subsubsection{Where is the object's center 19 seconds after the program started?}
