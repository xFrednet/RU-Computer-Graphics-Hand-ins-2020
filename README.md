# Computer Graphics: Hand-ins 2020
This repository holds my solutions to the hand-ins for the computer graphics course 2020 at Reykjavik University.

## Problems and Tasks
The problems and questions are examples from past exams and where provided by our instructor Kári Halldórsson. He confirmed me that I can open source these hand-ins along with my solutions.

The related lectures are available on [Youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsPUrqqamZvNk-Ov0YDbJQ/featured).
